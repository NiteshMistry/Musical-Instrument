<b>Looks fantastic and plays like a dream.</b>

 It comes with 2 necks—one with black nickel plating, and one made of rose brass with silver-plated finish. Both necks are engraved, have serial numbers to match the horn, and are specifically selected to match the individual characteristics of the instrument. A superb instrument and priced to make it a remarkable value for an instrument of such fine quality.
